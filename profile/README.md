At **Exein**, we are building the next-gen framework for the **Security of Things**, and we are on a mission to build it **open source**.

### Ecosystem

- [Pulsar](https://github.com/Exein-io/pulsar) - Blazing fast, eBPF-based **runtime security** for embedded devices.
- [Cosmo](https://github.com/Exein-io/cosmo-cli) - Advanced, hackable firmware image **security posture analysis** tool.
- [Kepler](https://github.com/Exein-io/kepler) - Open Source **CVE search engine** written entirely in Rust.
