## Hey, welcome to Exein 👋

![Fleet of devices protected by Cosmo](/images/cosmo-fleet.png)

At **Exein**, we are building the next-gen open source framework for the **Security of Things**, and we are on a mission to build it **open source**.

### 🦦 Ecosystem

There are many ways Exein can be used to make your devices more secure. Here are some to get you started:

- [Cosmo](https://cosmo.exein.io/) - Advanced, hackable device **security analysis** tool.
- [Pulsar](https://exein.io/pulsar) - Blazing fast **runtime protection** for IoT devices and containers.
- [Kepler](https://github.com/Exein-io/kepler) - Open Source **CVE search engine** written entirely in Rust.

### 👓 Next steps

We are about to open source our internal roadmap to that you can see where **Exein** is going, but in the meantime [let us know](https://github.com/Exein-io/community/discussions) what you would like to see built next. ✨ Oh, and by the way, if you are passionate about building a radically more secure IoT landscape and you love open source, [join us](https://linkedin.com/company/exein) 🙌.
